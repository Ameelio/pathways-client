        "In this version of Connect, you can receive but not send contact requests. Anyone on your currently approved call list can request you as a contact once they download the Connect app on their smartphone. When someone requests you as a contact, their status will appear as pending until their photo ID is verified by a facility staff member. Once verified, they will be added to your active contact list and able to schedule calls with you.",

While you are waiting, you can test the in-call features as well as check your video and audio connection.  (We recommend checking your video and audio connection at least once prior to a call.) Once the facility staff member is stationed and both you and your contact are in the Waiting Room, your call will automatically connect at the scheduled start time. All calls are [20] minutes long, and you may check how much time is remaining by toggling the in-call countdown display on/off. You may also leave and rejoin the call anytime within this [20]-minute time frame.",
